###Setting

Game takes place on a tidal-locked planet orbiting a red dwarf, creating a planet that is half-frozen and half-scorched, with a narrow
belt of livable land that encircles the planet. This belt is broken in two places, once near the north pole by a large mountain range,
and once abount 1/3 of the way around the belt by a large ocean (unsure about ocean, might not be geologically possible). 

People living on the planet are humanoids (as opposed to alien-looking). Are the remnants of near-future humans who were
searching for a planet to exploit for resources. 

The ship they used to get there crashed on the planet, with two main surviving parties separated by a mountain range. Those who
lived near the crashed ship use it as a reminder that they need to escape the planet, and come to worship the technology inside. 
Those on the other side salvage what they can and accept that it's unlikely they will ever leave. Those who stuck near the main
ship have developed some level of advanced technology (dieselpunk?) by emulating what was in their ship. However, they are in the smaller
portion of the planet, and so quickly exhaust what resources they have.

The conflict arises as the resources available on the planet begin thinning, and people are trying to figure out how to venture out into
the frozen and desert lands on either side of the belt in search of resources. The technologically advanced people attempt to cross
the mountains to the north, and run into their forgotten neighbors. 

The planet has a slightly higher oxygen concentration than earth, so a lot of the early colonists end up dying of Hyperoxemia, explaining how so much knowledge was lost over the relatively small timespan of a couple hundred years. Those who survived adapted, but it remains a disease amongst the uncivilized half of the planet, with high mortality, based on essentially random chance. This also means that the insects brought for terraforming in the colony ship were able to grow to really huge proportions.
