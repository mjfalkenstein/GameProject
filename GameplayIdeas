I was thinking the game would have 2 main states of gameplay, one for in-combat and one for out-of-combat. 

Out-of-combat would control similarly to the older pokemon games, or maybe the old legend of zelda games (depending on if we decide to
include grid-locking or not). The player would control each member of the party separately, and could command them to follow each other
or act on their own. Each character might have abilities that help solve puzzles or have relationships with other characters that are
necessary to speak with them (or something like that). 

In-combat would be almost along the lines of frozen synapse, where the player essentially pauses the game and queues up actions for each
character, which are then carried out simulatneously. For example, when a combat sequence begins, the player might have the tank walk up
to the enemy and taunt, while the other character performs ranged attacks. 

The game could switch between these two states when the player is spotted by an enemy NPC, and when all enemies in combat are defeated, or
the player chooses to flee the battle.
